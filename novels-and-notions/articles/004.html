Whether you have been part of a book club for years or are about to set up a new one, coming up with thought-provoking questions to get the conversation flowing can be just as tricky as deciding what to read next.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s why we decided to do the hard work for you and put together a helpful guide brimming with questions to cover all manner of reading material – plus a few book recommendations along the way! All that is left for you to do is grab your dog-eared books, prep your refreshments, and get ready to enjoy a lively discussion with your bookie friends.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A deep-dive into characters</strong><br><br>Elizabeth Bennett, Jay Gatsby, Bridget Jones... Throughout literary history, writers have created characters that have felt just as tangible as real people. Whether we love or loathe them, stepping into a character's shoes is a chance to explore new worlds and experiences, and reflect on the complexities of human nature in the process. These questions will help you delve into the characters and figure out what makes them tick:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Questions&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Did you like or dislike the characters and why? Did it influence how much you enjoyed the book?&nbsp;<br><br>Which character’s actions or decisions had the biggest impact on the plot, and how did it change the story?&nbsp;<br><br>Which character did you relate to the most?<br><br>Which character would be your ideal dinner guest?&nbsp;<br><br>What motivated a character to do what they did?&nbsp;<br><br>What might have happened to the characters after the book ended?&nbsp;<br><br>Did you trust the characters?&nbsp;<br><br>Were the characters based on real people, and how did that change your perception of them?&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Exploring the plot</strong><br><br>A plot-driven book is like a rollercoaster ride, taking you through a journey full of twists, turns and unexpected surprises. What sets these books apart is their focus on the events and actions that drive the story forward and keep readers on the edge of their seats.&nbsp;<br><br>There are so many techniques that authors use to tell their story that you may not even be aware a plot device is fundamental to understanding the story itself. Here are some questions to help you unravel their meaning...&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Questions&nbsp;</strong><br><br>If your book had a plot twist, were you genuinely surprised by it? How did it impact your reading experience?&nbsp;<br><br>How did the author effectively build tension and suspense throughout the story?&nbsp;<br><br>If your book had an ambiguous ending or unresolved plotlines, how did that make you feel? What do you think may have happened to the characters?&nbsp;<br><br>How did the setting contribute to the characters and the plot? Was it a place you would want to visit?&nbsp;<br><br>If your book contained more than one timeline, how did they enhance your understanding of the story and characters? Did you find one timeline more interesting than the other? How did they interplay<br><br>between the timelines contribute to the overall impact of the book?&nbsp;<br><br>If you could change one aspect of the plot, what would it be and how would it alter the story?&nbsp;<br><br>Was the plot based on true events? If so, how did it compare with your prior knowledge of the event? What did you learn?&nbsp;<br><br>Books adapted for the screen<br><br>Arguably, the rule of thumb is that the book is always better than the film. However, reading a book and watching the adaptation as part of your book club assignment is a fun way to add some Hollywood glamour to proceedings. Grab the popcorn and let’s get started....&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Questions&nbsp;</strong><br><br>How did the adaptation compare to the book? Did it capture the essence of the book, or were there significant differences? Which did you enjoy more?&nbsp;<br><br>What aspects that were changed in the adaptation did you enjoy or not enjoy?&nbsp;<br><br>Were there any characters or plot points that were altered or omitted in the adaptation? How did these changes impact the overall storytelling?&nbsp;<br><br>If you could change one aspect of the adaption to better align with the book, what would it be?&nbsp;<br><br>How did the adaptation influence your understanding of the characters and their development? Did it alter your understanding of their motivation and relationships compared to the book?&nbsp;<br><br>If you could only recommend either the movie or the book to a friend, which one would you choose?&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></section></main><section class="login-clean bg-light py-5"><form class="mb-5" method="post"><h2 class="my-3 px-4"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: unset;">Sign up to the N&amp;N's Newsletter</span></strong></h2><h6 class="my-4 px-4"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the latest books, recommendations, author interviews and more</span></h6><div class="d-flex mb-3 bdy-min"><input class="form-control nwl_email font-anonymous" type="email" name="email" placeholder="E-mail" disabled=""><button class="d-block fw-bold butom" type="submit">SIGN UP</button></div><p class="my-4 px-4 grey px14">By signing up, I confirm that I'm over 16.
